##### OpenBSD Routing

# To turn ON routing for IPV4 (add the following in sysctl.conf)
net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
net.inet.ip.mforwarding=1 # just if multicasting is needed

# To turn ON routing for IPV6 (add the following in sysctl.conf)
net.inet6.ip6.forwarding=1
net.inet6.ip6.mforwarding=1 # just if multicasting is needed

# Add a static route (sample) # nano /etc/hostname.em0 (just add the !route add line to the desired network interface config, em0 in this case)

inet 169.254.100.1 255.255.0.0
        inet alias 169.254.101.1 255.255.0.0

# the gateway is 169.254.1.1 in this example
!route add -net 169.254.0.0/16 169.254.1.1

# END
