##### OpenBSD Ports HowTo

### Installing ports sources: ports.tar.gz will be unarchived into /usr to have /usr/ports
su -
cp ports.tar.gz /usr
cd /usr
tar -xzf ports.tar.gz
#rm ports.tar.gz
chown -R admin:wheel /usr/ports

##### Ports Fetch from CVS: Stable - OpenBSD 6.2, as alternative to using the ports.tar.gz as above
cvs -qd anoncvs@anoncvs2.ca.openbsd.org:/cvs get -rOPENBSD_6_2 -P src
cvs -qd anoncvs@anoncvs2.ca.openbsd.org:/cvs get -rOPENBSD_6_2 -P ports

##### Ports Fetch from CVS: LATEST, as alternative to using the ports.tar.gz as above
cvs -qd anoncvs@anoncvs2.ca.openbsd.org:/cvs get -P src
cvs -qd anoncvs@anoncvs2.ca.openbsd.org:/cvs get -P ports

### Ports Pre-Build
echo "SUDO=/usr/bin/doas" >> /etc/mk.conf
echo "#SUDO=/usr/local/bin/sudo" >> /etc/mk.conf
echo "LDFLAGS += -m64 -O3" >> /etc/mk.conf
echo "CFLAGS += -m64 -O3" >> /etc/mk.conf
echo "CXXFLAGS += -m64 -O3" >> /etc/mk.conf

### Compile ports (example: compiling midnight commander from ports: sysutils/mc)
# to build ports require to run make as unprivileged user (ex: admin) in group wheel but set in doas ; see above that all ports dirs and files were # chown -R admin:wheel /usr/ports
cd /usr/ports/sysutils/mc
make clean
make package BULK=Yes
# the compiled package binary will be located into /usr/ports/packages/amd64/all as mc-x.y.z.tgz
cd /usr/ports/some/otherport
FLAVOR="no_gnome3" make package BULK=Yes
SUBPACKAGE="-gtk2" make package BULK=Yes
SUBPACKAGE="-utils" make package BULK=Yes
#libreoffice (5.2 must compile as non-root)
cd /usr/ports/editors/libreoffice
SUBPACKAGE="-main" FLAVOR="no_java no_lang" make package BULK=Yes
SUBPACKAGE="-main" FLAVOR="no_lang" make package BULK=Yes
# evince
cd /usr/ports/graphics/evince
FLAVOR="light" make package BULK=Yes

# Installing a port: if the port was not previous installed will install it if all dependencies are met: all required packages were built ... some packages depends on other packages
# Updating a port: if the port was previous installed and the current version x.y.z is greated than previous detected version will be updated
cd /usr/ports/packages/amd64/all
pkg_add -D unsigned mc-x.y.z.tgz

#! Install or update newer ports
pkg_add -D unsigned *.tgz
#! Mark all installed packages as automated
pkg_add -D unsigned -aa *.tgz
#! After, force replace all packages, without replacing etc/%pkg-configs% (may be needed as after upgrading a package others were built on it - different version)
pkg_add -D unsigned -rU *.tgz

# Force installing many ports at once
pkg_add -aa -D unsigned -I *.tgz

# Force replacing many ports at once
pkg_add -r -D unsigned -I *.tgz

# Removing a port (if other ports depend on it they will be also removed)
pkg_delete mc-x.y.z

# Removing all installed ports
pkg_delete -X

# Checking port source checksums:
make checksum

# Updating port source checksums (if version was upgraded in Makefile of the port)
make makesum

# Cleaning a port after make
make clean

# Display port flavors:
make show=FLAVORS

# Display current selected port flavors:
make show=FLAVOR

# Display port sub-packages:
make show=PKGNAMES

# Display current selected port sub-packages:
make show=PKGNAME

# Sample Fixes:
# comment out some dependencies in file-roller (Makefile) before make: gcpio, unrar, cdrtools

# Help on ports add, update, delete:
man pkg_add
man pkg_delete

### Ports Signify
# If you want to build your own signed packages, you'll first need to create keys for signing
# Note the names: keys for signing packages should be in the following format {something}-pkg.*
signify -Gns /etc/signify/my-pkg.sec -p /etc/signify/my-pkg.pub
# How to sign existing packages after building them with pkg_sign(1).
cd /usr/ports/packages/$(uname -p)
pkg_sign -s signify -s /etc/signify/my-pkg.sec -o signed -S all
# Alternative, we may add the following line to /etc/mk.conf to directly build signed packages by default when we build ports from source:
SIGNING_PARAMETERS=-s signify -s /etc/signify/my-pkg.sec

### Sample Hints on Building PHP XDebug extension
cd /home/admin/sources
tar xzf xdebug-2.4.1.tar.gz
cd xdebug-2.4.1
AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.65 AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.15 phpize-5.6
AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.65 AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.15 ./configure --with-php-config=/usr/local/bin/php-config-5.6

### Generate checksum hashes for distfiles
cd distfiles
find . -type f -exec md5 '{}' \; > /__distfiles-openbsd-unixw-xxyyzz.CHECKSUM
find . -type f -exec sha256 '{}' \; >> /__distfiles-openbsd-unixw-xxyyzz.CHECKSUM
find . -type f -exec sha512 '{}' \; >> /__distfiles-openbsd-unixw-xxyyzz.CHECKSUM

#END
