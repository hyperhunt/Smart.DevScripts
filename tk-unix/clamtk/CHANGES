	  when Gnome removed images from buttons
	* Fixed an issue specific to CentOS where the wrong directory
	  gets checked for definitions, resulting in older
          definitions

	* Minor fixes to quarantine restoration
	* Added an extra check to ensure files reviewed in
	  quarantine are regular files (and not directories)
	* Added option to scan or ignore files under ~/.gvfs and
	  ~/smb4k.  By default, the option is ignore. We'll expand
          this as needed. The idea is to allow or disallow
          scanning of smb-mounted drives
	* Scanning speed has been optimized by filtering unwanted
	  directories and files prior to collection phase. Thanks
	  to Dan for reporting this (Launchpad #697614)
	* Removed extraneous language strings. No point in

4.23 - Jan 17 2010
------------------

	  descending, via modification timestamp. Cannot do a sort

	  We are now rpmlint clean! Thanks, Jerome!

4.15 - Jun 20 2009
------------------
	* DNS improvements added (App.pm) for comparing AV engine
	  versions. This fixes an excessive timeout problem
	  Special thanks to everyone who reported it and OpenDNS
	  for assistance in the fix!
	* Added Arabic language file. Thanks, Nawaf!

4.14 - Jun 13 2009
------------------

	  Jean-Luc!
	* Updated Chinese (zh_CN) language file. Thanks, Aron!
	* Updated Dutch (nl_NL) language file. Thanks, Rob!
	* Updated rpm spec file (desktop-file-install).
	* Improved display of updater dialog

4.13 - May 25 2009
------------------
	* Added Dutch (nl_BE) language file. Thanks, Frederik!
	* Added Greek (el_GR) language file. Thanks, Alexandros!
	* Updated Romanian (ro_RO) language file. Thanks, Adrian!
	* Minor updates to Spanish language file. Thanks!
	* Updated desktop file
	* Several tweaks to Debian/Ubuntu build
	* Removed clamtk-kde.desktop file

4.12 - Apr 25 2009
------------------
	* Added Turkish (tr) language file. Thanks, Gürkan!
	* Updated French (fr) language file. Thanks, Sébastien!
	* Updated Brazilian (pt_BR) language file. Thanks, Felipe!
	* Updated Spanish (es_ES) language file. Thanks, Dairon!
	* Added clamav-update to CentOS spec file requirements for
	  freshclam functionality.
	* Added Net::DNS requirement and removed bind requirement.
	  This is installed by default on most Linux systems. Thanks,
	  Alceu! I will look for a way to eventually remove this
	  requirement, though.

4.11 - Mar 22 2009
------------------
	* Debian-only fix: clamtk.desktop file fixed.
	  (use the correct image, on right-click).
        * Added Slovak (sk_SK) language file. Thanks, Tomas!
        * Updated Spanish (es_ES) language file. Thanks, Heriberto!
        * Updated Korean (ko_KR) language file. Thanks, Jongwoo!
        * Minor French (fr) language file fixes. Thanks, David!

4.10 - Feb 18 2009
------------------
	* Fixed situation where signatures were not
	  accurately counted. Thanks, Paul and Brett
	* Re-added Debian patches, mistakenly removed

4.09 - Feb 14 2009
------------------
        * Added missing gettext() in Update.pm. Thanks, Eun Joon!
	* Updated Swedish language file. Thanks, Petter!
	* Updated Czech (cs_CZ) language file. Thanks, Karel!
	* Updated Korean (ko_KR) language file. Thanks, Eun Joon!

4.08 - Dec 28 2008
------------------
	* Minor fix to correct parsing of scanned files. Thanks, Tom!
	* The status of moved files is now shown clearly
	* Minor fix for when ClamTk attempts to scan
          non-readable directories
	* Improved directory listing in history log

4.07 - Dec 20 2008
------------------
	* Added missing module requirement File::Copy
	* Fixed some save-as dialogs

4.06 - Dec 07 2008
------------------
	* Fixed the way we check the status of the AV engine. This
	  requires the "host" command, which is pretty standard on
	  most Linux distros. For Fedora, it's "bind-utils"; for
	  Debian, it's "bind9-host". I'm still adding it to the
	  requirements just to be safe

4.05 - Nov 28 2008
------------------
	* Fixed issues with commandline options (parsing
          full path or filename). This requires the Cwd module,
          but should not require any changes to overall dependencies
	* Updated Slovene language file to 4.x series
          Thanks, Martin!
	* Updated Italian language file to 4.x series
          Thanks, Alessandro!
	* Fixed two issues with the saving of settings. Thanks, Rick!
	* Temporarily removed startup delay. It will return shortly

4.04 - Nov 16 2008
------------------
	* Minor language update: from "scanned your system recently"
	  to "Date of last virus scan", to avoid confusion
	* Changed ClamAV engine test to startup for testing
	  whether or not it's current
	* Fixed a condition where ClamTk was not finding the
	  signatures
	* Will temporarily maintain Debian builds
        * Updated Chinese language file to 4.x series. Thanks, Aron!
        * Updated Swedish language file to 4.x series. Thanks, Petter!

4.03 - Nov 9 2008
------------------
	* Updated Polish, French, Russian and Brazilian
          language files to 4.x series. Thanks to
          Piotr, Arnaud, Vitaly, Bruno and Fabrice!
	* Added a few missing "gettext" areas. Thanks,
          Arnaud and Bruno!
	* Improved the display of the output of infections and
          the logs.  Thanks, Arnaud!
	* Added more descriptive dialog information during updates
	* Finally changed the clamtk.xpm icon from the ClamAV icon

4.02 - Oct 26 2008
------------------
	* Fixed encoding problems. Thanks, Marcin!
	* Removed rar/unrar functionality altogether. I originally
	  thought only Debian/Ubuntu and CentOS had removed it from
	  ClamAV, but apparently so has OpenSuSE and who knows
	  what other distros. Better to just remove it altogether
	* Updated Korean language file to 4.x series. Thanks, Gina!
	* GUI wording fixed (duplicate use of 'thorough').
          Thanks, Fabrice!
	* Applied permissions fix for a possibly Debian-only problem
	  during signature updates. Thanks, David!
	* Changed a "die" into a "warn" for a condition where ClamTk
	  finds only one part of the virus signatures. Thanks, David!
	* Fixed a condition where the signature updater will almost
	  always return "Update failed"

4.01 - Oct 19 2008
------------------
	* Added missing Locale::gettext to startup script (clamtk)
	  and others. This fixes a rare error message
	* Added error message for failed config file writes
	* Added missing requirement "zenity" to spec file
	* Updated README documentation to 4.x series
	* Updated the clamtk.po language file template
	* Updated the Dutch (nl) language file. Thanks, Rob!
	* Fixed spacing issue to prevent stretching of text in
	  the Actions frame.
	* Fixed condition where GUI update check was returning
	  incorrect status

4.00 - Oct 13 2008
------------------
	* There are quite a few changes in this release.
	  Among the most notable is the ability of any user
	  to maintain their own sig database and update them.
	  Please see the file "README.4.0" for more

3.11 - Aug 28 2008
------------------
	* Added Japanese language file. Updated *.desktop
	  files. Thanks Hajime!
	* Updated Italian language file. Thanks Alessandro!
	* Updated Chinese language file. Thanks Aron!
	* Changed German language file to UTF-8
          (Launchpad Bug 247356)
	* Improved virus signature location detection
	* Removed the "resizing of the window" effect
          (Sourceforge bug; Request ID 1999249)

3.10 - Jun 14 2008
-------------------
	* Improved readability in menubars. Thanks Fabrice!
	* Updated French language file. Thanks Fabrice!
	* Updated Korean language file. Thanks Gina C!
	* Updated Dutch language file. Thanks Rob!
	* Added temporary block for email directories (.thunderbird,
	  .mozilla-thunderbird, .evolution) - do not
	  quarantine or delete possible viruses. ClamTk cannot parse
	  individual files from there yet. Should probably add
	  the .mozilla directory since some email directories may
	  be there as well
	* Added the newer clamtk-kde.desktop file, which contains
	  Dutch language support. (Still available as a separate
	  package)
	* Changed clamtk.desktop file Icon line from
          clamtk.png to clamtk because some specification
          I've never heard of told me to.

3.09 - May 25 2008
------------------
	* Added support for .cld files
	* Added Dutch language (nl_NL) file. Thanks Rob!

3.08 - Feb 5 2008
-----------------
	* Fixed symbolic links/recursion bug. Thanks, David!
	* Fixed display error - incorrectly displaying
          100%, occurring at 255-file intervals
	* Fixed CentOS bug where definitions were not accurately
	  counted. Includes fix so Ubuntu will count correctly
          as well
	* Minor fix with formatting (substr outside of string error)
	* Minor fix to enfoce not scanning /proc, /sys, or /dev
	* Neater parsing with version of ClamAV
	* Korean language file added. Thanks, chopchey!
	* Romanian language file added. Thanks, Veronica!
	* Italian language file updated. Thanks, Alessandro!
	* Updated French language file. Thanks, David!
	* Minor cleanups, including removing 40 lines of excess code.
	* The clamtk-kde.desktop file will be included, at least
	  temporarily. There is no real difference between this
	  and the one in its own package

3.07 - Jan 19 2008
------------------
	* No longer supporting ClamAV < 0.90. This should
          be okay - most distros are onto 0.90+
	* Added the Slovene (sl_SI) language file. Thanks, Martin!
	* Updated the Italian (it_IT) language file.
          Thanks, Alessandro!
	* New dependency: Perl module Config::Tiny.
          RPM distros usually name this perl-Config-Tiny;
          Debian-based systems usually name this
          libconfig-tiny-perl. This gives the ability to save scan
	  option settings between sessions through a simple
          "prefs" file

3.06 - Dec 30 2007
------------------
	* Ensure /var/lib/clamav is checked first so old definition
	  directories won't get picked up by accident.
          Thanks, Darren!
	* Updated mimetype associations. Thanks, Vito!

3.05 - Dec 15 2007
------------------
	* Changed save-as from copy to move - no point in keeping
	  the file in two places
	* Added options for Quick and Full Home Scans underneath the
	  'File' menu
	* Fixed a minor bug preventing the correct display of the
	  number of files scanned
	* Fixed a bug regarding scanning with large numbers of files.
	  Apparently there's a limit to the number of arguments a
	  program can receive at once... who knew? :)
          Thanks, Matthias!
	* Removed three duplicates from desktop file

3.04 - Sep 15 2007
------------------
	* Improvement to ensure all downloaded files are visible for
	  the save-as function

3.03 - Sep 13 2007
------------------
	* Added "Save As" function as a post-scan option. This is
	  useful for times when ClamTk intercepts a file download; it
	  can be scanned and then saved from its temporary folder
	* Added File::Copy to handle the above; since it is
	  distributed with Perl, it should not require any new
	  dependencies
	* Removed now-unused subroutine

3.02 - Sep 9 2007
-----------------
	* Galician language file (gl_ES) has been added. Thanks,
	  Román!
	* CentOS rpms now have the .el5 suffix. I don't actually HAVE
	  RHEL, but this is in line with Dag's naming
	* Re-added the out-of-date virus signatures warning

3.01 - Aug 31 2007
------------------
	* Small fixes to display the correct virus db information
	* Swedish language file added to Debian and FC3 builds

3.00 - Aug 8 2007
-----------------
	* Extended the signature updates time - it's usually needed
	* Fixed the Russian language file, which is now UTF-8.
	  Thanks, Vitaly!
	* Added a line for internal encoding. Thanks, Vitaly!
	* Added Swedish language file. Thanks, Petter!

2.99 - Jun 25 2007
-------------------
	* Removed hundreds of excess lines.
	* GUI changes.
	* Most language files updated.
	* The "Delete Infected Files" option has been removed.
	* "No Maximum Size" option has been added. It may be changed
	  in the future to allow for more choice.

2.32 - May 13 2007
------------------
	* Several more fixes, all affecting ClamAV 0.90 users
	  This will likely be the last 2.* release, barring any major
	  problems
	  Thanks to Reid T. for his generous time and help!

2.31 - Mar 24 2007
------------------
	* The Polish translation (pl_PL) has been updated and
	  now uses UTF-8. Thanks Robert (PLD)!

2.30 - Mar 10 2007
------------------
	* This release fixes issues when using ClamAV 0.90

2.29 - Mar 4 2007
-----------------
	* Will now use {daily,main}.cvd.rpmnew if {daily,main}.cvd
	  files are not found. This should only impact rpm-based
	  distros, and even then should only last until the user
	  runs freshclam to update

2.28 - Feb 24 2007
------------------
	* Added Czech (cs_CZ) language support. Thanks Karel!
	* Minor change to allow for mostly 0.90 rc support - probably
	  not totally ready yet

2.27 - Jan 11 2007
------------------
	* Testing new clamtk icon! Provide feedback!
	  Thanks to Gerald Ganson and http://openclipart.org.
	  Keeping the clamtk.xpm (new format) for the Debian .menu
	* Minor changes to be more backwards-compatible with
	  older versions of Gtk2
	* Improved size function to be more precise
	* Updated the .desktop file; may change this again

2.26 - Oct 28 2006
------------------
	* Fixed a display lag with files scanned and the display
	* Minor cleanups (improved two subs)
	* Extended the signature update timeout slightly

2.25 - Oct 18 2006
------------------
	* Fixed bug whereby files were not being deleted when
	  requested
	* A few other cleanups

2.24 - Sep 23 2006
------------------
	* Added additional language support - Spanish
          (es_ES), Polish (pl_PL)
	* Updated most translation files - fixes the change from 2.22
	  ("Select Files")
	* Extended the signature update timeout time. This is
	  because there have been more frequent - and therefore
          larger - updates. This was occasionally
          misinterpreted as not having been able to update

2.23 - Aug 13 2006
------------------
	* Recursive scanning works again
	* Updated rpm specfile. Thanks to Vitaly
	* Updated Brazilian (pt_BR) translation. Thanks to Andre M
	* Updated File selection to Gtk2 interface. Thanks to Andre M
	* Stop functionality has been improved

2.22 - Jul 29 2006
------------------
	* Added additional language support - Russian (ru_RU)
	* Multiple files can be selected with the "Scan a File"
	  option now

2.21 - Jul 04 2006
------------------
	* Added additional language support - French (fr_FR) and
	  Italian (it_IT)
	* Cleaned up the About dialog
	* The Italian and Danish translations and their lines
	  in the .desktop files were updated
	* Added /dev to list of directories (such as /proc and /sys)
	  where files cannot be automatically deleted
	* Minor gui enhancements

2.20 - Jun 17 2006
------------------
	* First i18n version - support for German (de_DE), Portugese
	  (pt_BR), Danish (da_DK), and Chinese (zh_CN)!
	  This requires a new requirement: perl-gettext
	* Removed clamtk.xml file
	* Changed initial warning dialog to be more generic and not
	  Fedora-centric (regarding the editing of freshclam.conf)

2.19 - May 15 2006
------------------
	* Added additional paths to look for daily.cvd and main.cvd
	  (/usr/share/clamav and /usr/local/share/clamav). Thanks
          to Ronny S
	* Fixed an issue where quarantined viruses were not being
	  removed (under "Empty Quarantine Folder"). Thanks to Ronny S
	* Improved older code (eg., format => printf);
          mostly PBP-compliant!
	* Re-added --block-encrypted to clamscan scanning options.
	  Obviously not all encrypted rars/zips are viruses, but this
	  may provide some warning for those that are

2.18 - May 06 2006
------------------
	* Finally fixed some column sizing issues in the display
	* Updated some .desktop file translations (fr,pl,pt,pt_BR ).
	  (Thanks to Alain B., PLD Linux, Andre F.)
	* Combined the View Histories and Manage Histories options
	  under the View tab

2.17 - Apr 22 2006
------------------
	* Removed delete option if scanning /proc or /sys to
	  avoid $bad_things. Scanning is still permitted
	* Able to release single Fedora Core rpm now rather than
	  a separate one for FC3 (due to outdated perl-Gtk2 rpm)
	* Changed the required clamav rpm version back to >= 83. The
	  latest and greatest clamav technically isn't required, although
	  it would be better to use it
	* Changed the required perl-Gtk2 version back to >= 1.102.
	  A small code change can check for which version is installed.
	  Thanks to Muppet
	* Changed max size of file scanned from 15MB to 20MB

2.16 - Mar 21 2006
------------------
	* Fixed bug where non-existant subroutine called
	  (due to it being renamed several versions ago)
	* The man page was cleaned up
	* Fixed Korean translation
	* FC3's perl-Gtk2 is outdated - separate release is necessary.

2.15 - Feb 12 2006
------------------
	* Fixed number of virus signatures count
	* Added option to hide the gui toolbar (ctrl-T)
	* Removed unnecessary Gtk2::SimpleMenu dependency
	* Re-added tooltips for right-click options
	* Added man page
	* Added some translations to the .desktop file
	  (German, French, Spanish, Italian, Korean, Chinese)
	* Changed arch of rpms to noarch since it's perl. They are
	  now rpmlint-clean
	* Removed fc4/fc3 from spec files. One rpm should suffice

2.14 - Jan 20 2006
------------------
	* Commandline options are accepted again. This goes towards
	  being able to right-click and scan via file browsers like
	  konqueror, nautilus, and eventually xffm
	* Added better warning for when "Delete" is selected from the
	  onset (toolbar)
	* Improved menubar code
	* Added Option to "Follow Symbolic Links". This could be used for
	  scanning certain directories, but may be removed if deemed
	  not useful
	* When files that are symbolic links and tagged as infected, the
	  target file is not quarantined or deleted, only the linked name
	  Added a warning to the README regarding this. This is in line
	  with the way 'clamscan --remove' works in the same situation
	* Added more keyboard shortcuts
	* Combined some popup code into the same subroutine

2.13 - Jan 1 2006
-----------------
	* Added right-click functionality to quarantine and delete
	  Should be much safer than initially selecting "Delete" (under
	  "Actions") and running it. This will prevent false-positive
 	  mistakes
	* Removed File::Copy as a dependency
	* Removed single-click tooltips on the SimpleList - they're
	  unnecessary now
	* Now using 'insert' to avoid using deprecated commands (toolbar)

2.12 - Dec 24 2005
------------------
	* Histories can now also be individually deleted
	* Added "--broken-executable" to clamscan options (under
          "Options"), which may be useful in some cases.
	* Added quick warning for when the Delete option
          (under "Actions") is selected
	* Removed LWP::Simple as a dependency, since it hasn't been used
	  or needed in quite some time. Spec and control
          files can be updated accordingly
	* Extended virus update timeout from 10 to 15

2.11 - Dec 10 2005
------------------
	* Fixed minor issue with getting files
	* Rows are now single-clicked for more info.
          Removed "sub row_clicked"
	  Attempted to make the status more readable

2.10 - Nov 27 2005
------------------
	* Fixed feature with the stop button where it crashed
          if the scanner wasn't running
	* Moved "directories scanned" feature back in (logs)

2.09 - Nov 26 2005
------------------
	* Fixed speed issue - should be very close to command line speed
	* Moved size column back in - had been removed to deal with some
	  issues

2.08: - Nov 11 2005
-------------------
	* Fixed justification problem with $top_label (set_justify) (?)
	* Fixed quarantine/delete bug where, when a file in an archive is
	  detected as a virus, it continues to try to quarantine/delete
	  the archive
	* Removed cabextract functionality
	* Removed "size" display. Size only comes into play when greater
	  than 15MiB (checked during the scan routine)
	* Using SIG{ALRM} for timeout on signature updates now
	* Not all file types are detected by the 'file' command -
	  added 'unknown' for these
	* FC3 spec file changed - now written for Fedora Extras.
	  This means that the ClamAV dependencies are clamav, clamav-lib,
	  and clamav-data

2.07 - Oct 22 2005
------------------
	* Fixed a bug which does not accurately display the total
	  number of files scanned (when "Show All Files" is NOT selected)
	* Fixed .cab detection bug (incorrect regex) which prevented
	  cabinet files from being scanned

2.06 - Aug 28 2005
------------------
	* Added maintenance false positive fix (rename file)
	* Fixed quarantine bug where additional ".VIRUS" was added
	* Added 'Directories Scanned' information to log
	* Startup now also searches under /usr/local/bin for required
  	  binaries in case of manual installation of those binaries.
	  (ie., /usr/bin/ or /usr/local/bin). This should make
	  it easier for porting and for folks who manually install
	  ClamAV

2.05 - Aug 20 2005
------------------
	* Added quarantine maintenance option for more
	  refined control over quarantined files
	* Minor bug fix

2.04 - Jul 17 2005
------------------
	* Support for scanning Cabinet files added

2.03 - Jul 9 2005
-----------------
	* Fixed multiple recursion-related bugs
	* Fixed freeze-up due to file-name interpretation
	* Minor code-cleanup

2.02 - Jul 3 2005
------------------
	* Fixed a bug where rars within rars were not handled
	  properly, causing a freeze-up
	* Added "Scan your home directory" button

2.01 - Jun 26 2005
------------------
	* Occasionally the window size will be skewed due to long
	  file names - the "Clear Output" button now resizes it back
	  to the normal size
	* The one-time popup window is now only for the root account,
	  since it only concerns root during the virus signature updates

2.00-2
------------------
	* Tweaked the spec file for use with fedora extras.
	  (clamav, clamav-update, clamav-data)
	* Changed location of daily.cvd - now under /var/lib/clamav
	* Added one-time popup window to warn users that the
	  fedora extras rpms do not automatically edit freshclam.conf
	  or clamd.conf

2.00 - Jun 11 2005
------------------
	* Code change: now using SimpleMenu for menu
	  generation because... well, it's simpler
	* Source is now in the form of clamtk-$VERSION.tar.gz
	* Other minor fixes

1.99 - May 18 2005
------------------
	* Added test for internet connection before launching
	  signature updates to avoid freeze-up. Still takes a minute
	  to timeout, though, if there are problems
	* File-type format tweaks
	* Removed text from stock-icons - they didn't
	  necessarily fit the description

1.98 - May 9 2005
-----------------
	* Fixed text glitch in history view/delete
	* Added confirmation dialog to "Delete Histories"
	* Minor gui tweaks - "System Information" now holds
	  ClamAV version, Signature Date, and Front-end version
	* Abbreviated menubar items (feature request)
	* Documentation (README) updated

1.97 - May 3 2005
-----------------
	* Fixed bug where some files were reported as an "Error"

1.96 - May 1 2005
-----------------
	* Moved the stop button to the top, which not only
	  looks smoother having all the images in the same row,
	  but makes the program run better too
	* Hitting the "Clear the output" button while the program
	  is still running isn't a problem per se, but it skews
	  the "double-click for more info" information. So, that's
	  been changed/fixed

1.95 - Apr 30 2005
------------------
	* Mostly cosmetic changes, to include a top toolbar
	  for more point-and-click-ability
	* Also began... gasp... commenting the code
	* I'm removing the "beta" tag, although it is - because
	  this (gtk2) is going to be the default now
	* This version "obsoletes" the Tk version, since I'll
	  be working full-time on the gtk2 version

1.94 - Apr 27 2005
------------------
	* Changed row-double-clicks to show full filename
	* Added Function-key shortcuts to the Scan Options selections,
	  just like the Tk version
	* Removed some worthless code
	* Fixed freeze-up during root's check for updates
	* Added some locale stuff in a BEGIN loop

1.93 - Apr 22 2005
------------------
	* Weird display problems during scanning AFTER
	  viewing histories has been temporarily fixed
	* File and Directory selection starts automatically in
	  the user's home directory

1.92
------------------
	* Oops, display problems fixed
	* Should run smoother now

1.91
------------------
	* Minor tweaks

1.90
------------------
	* Initial testing release of the Gtk2 version
	* Added a startup subroutine to combine all the
	  startup checks

1.0.10 - Mar 14 2005
--------------------
	* Tons more added to clamtk.pm, since I dorked the
 	  upload again with 1.0.9. :)
	* No longer checking for "corrupt" rars, since I'm
	  getting lots of false positives. That means we can
	  remove IO::File
	* Tweaked some of the {type} displays for neater
	  formatting
	* Not much else changed. No big whoop

1.0.9 - Mar 13 2005
-------------------
	* Tweaked virus-date function for better handling.
	* Added function-key binding for the "Scan Options"
	  (F1, F2, F3)
	* Changed key-binding for cvd_check to Ctrl-C.
	  Added key-bind Ctrl-S to Stop scanning; the stop
	  button is now a separate file for the rpm
	* Began move to clamtk.pm to reduce clutter - users
	  should not notice any real difference. For now, it's
	  stored in the same directory as README, etc., but that
	  may change

1.0.8 - Mar 7 2005
------------------
	* New feature: viewing and deleting the history
	  logs under the "View" button. Also, the Clear
	  Output option was moved to the View button since it
	  has nothing to do with Scan Options
	* More format and other tweaking
	* Finally removed background from clam.xpm

1.0.7 - Mar 4 2005
------------------
	* Re-fixed old bug which can detect gzips and bzips
	  as zip files...
	* Fixed "Scan File" crash bug
	* Removed dependency perl-Archive-Zip

1.0.6 - Feb 28 2005
-------------------
	* Experimental warning if viruses are >= 5 days old.
  	  Works, but uses (the awesome but slow) Date::Manip for
	  parsing. Date::Manip comes with FC3, so there shouldn't
	  be any major problems...
	* Fixed bug where, if scanning a zip/rar file's directory,
	  the stop button wouldn't work until that directory
 	  was empty
	* Tweaked the logging format - should be neater and easier
	  to read
	* Removed File::stat - using (stat($file))[7] now.
	  No sense using a module where it isn't needed
	* Quarantine startup check has been moved
	* The clam.xpm file has the Tk logo on it now. It's so
 	  small, no one will notice anyway

1.0.5 - Feb 26 2005
-------------------
	* 1.0.4 was a bad upload; sorry. This fixes some file
	  and directory parsing
	* Also, homemade encrypted rar-detection is no more.
	  Clamscan now does all the detection

1.0.4 - Feb 26 2005
-------------------
	* Socket files are not currently supported by ClamAV; this
	  is now correctly reflected if scanned. Also, links are no
	  longer followed
	* Another encrypted rar signature added. Gotta be an easier
	  way...
	* Minor tweaks, bug fixes, and code rewrites

1.0.3 - Feb 20 2005
-------------------
	* Certain file types return ridiculously long descriptions.
	  Descriptions are now limited to four words. This will be
	  tweaked again later
	* Encrypted rar detection was enhanced

1.0.2 - Feb 20 2005
-------------------
	* Removed need for File::Type. Using the system command "file"
	  produces much cleaner output (e.g., instead of "octet-stream"
	  for word documents, it now reports "Microsoft Office
	  Document")
	* Fixed bug where only file types beginning with "application"
    	  were being shown. This was blocking types like
	  "image/gif"
	* Added command-line gui option (thanks to Kevin O.)
	* Both unrar and rar rpms are accepted. Now, if unrar is not
	  installed but rar is, ClamTk will use rar

1.0.1 - Feb 14 2005
-------------------
	* Fixed unzip/unrar recursion problem
	* Fixed quarantine problem

1.0
-------------------
	* Certain files containing spaces were not being properly scanned
	* Re-added quarantine scanning, which was accidentally removed
	* Removed 'version'-check functionality since I'm moving the
	  project to sourceforge.net. Might be added later
	* Minor code tweaks

1.0-rc2
-------------------
	* Added new stop button (.xpm) which is included in the script,
          not as an extra file

1.0-rc1
-------------------
	* Included stop button (thanks to Kevin O.)

0.9.9.9
-------------------
	* Added the capability to rescan quarantined files
	* Viruses in the quarantine directory now have ".VIRUS" appended.
	  Also, permissions are changed on them

0.9.9.8
-------------------
	* Added the quarantine directory
