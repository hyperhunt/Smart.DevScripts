<b>  Visual Perl/Tk editor (widget edition) - tutorial</b>

<b> Introduction </b>

  This document created as 1st responce to VPTK_W users that
requested some "howto" information about interactive GUI 
development. Since it's a non-commercial, open source project,
and the author is not professional technical writer the 
document could be considered as starting-level tutorial.
If you've any questions, suggestions or bug reports - please
let me know and I'll do my best to proceed it as soon as
possible. Good luck!

<b> Lesson 1. Getting started </b>

  Run vptk_w.pl from path where it's installed in your system. If 
your environment variable $PATH (or %PATH% in MS Win) contain path
to VPTK directory you can just run vptk_w.pl without full path. 
Refer to your system adminstrator if you are failing to run vptk_w.pl
For GUI environment that support desktop icons or launchpads it
could be useful to create shortcut with icon of your choice.

  Needless to say that you should run vptk_w.pl in GUI environment
(console-only connection is not enough) and Perl/Tk should be 
installed. Good test for both of mentioned conditions is "widgets"
demo program supplied with Perl/Tk - if you succeeded to run it,
than most chances that vptk_w.pl will run too.

  In the picture below you can see main elements of the editor:
<img src="tutorial_l1_3.gif">

1 - widgets tree; hierarhy presentation of your design
2 - application window; here design displayed "as is"
3 - current selection; most of editor operations performed with
  currently selected widget and it's sub-widgets (if any)
4 - modification flag; indicator that reflect modification status.
  When star displayed here your design should be saved to retain
  last changes

  All the rest elements are quite intuitive - you can guess their
function using common sense and computer environment experience.
For details please refer to vptk_w.pl built-in help.

<b> Lesson 2. Creating simple GUI application </b>

  Let's start vptk_w.pl and try to create kind of "Hello, world!"
application.

  At the beginnig, you can see poping-up 'project settings' window. 
Here you can specify window title, project description and other 
common parameters.

<img src="tutorial_l1_1.gif">

  Now let's start to put some contents. Generally you can create 
widgets after, before and under selected widget. Since at the 
beginning our design is empty we can create only sub-widget of 
main window (mw).

<img src="tutorial_l2_2.gif">

In pop-up window let's select "LabEntry" widget type. The widget 
of this type is capable to display prompt message and accept user 
input. It will be a main element of our sample design.

<img src="tutorial_l1_2.gif">

Just click on 'Proceed' in next dialog box - widget object 
variables are out of our scope.

<img src="tutorial_l2_4.gif">

Let's repeat the same insert action and create two button-type
elements so our design will look like on picture presented before:

<img src="tutorial_l1_3.gif">

Now our widgets already placed under main window and ready to run, 
but we've to connect those widgets (from functional point of view) 
in order to allow this program to produce some results.

Double-click on LabEntry widget to get widget's properties
window. On the left you can see widget-specific properties and on 
the right - geometry management controls. Let's leave default 
geometry manager for this lesson and concentrate on widget's content.

Enter prompt message "Your name:" in field "-label". In field 
"-textvariable" enter reference to variable "name" as shown on 
picture below:

<img src="tutorial_l1_4.gif">

Click "Accept" button on the bottom of dialog window - now your
changes stored in LabEntry_001 properties.

Let's open the 1st button properties and connect it to
card printing procedure. Scroll down properties and in field 
"-text" enter "Print a card". Click "Accept" and go to main menu.
Select "File" -&gt; "Project properties" and go to "User code
after main loop". 

<img src="tutorial_l1_5.gif">

Type procedure name "postcard" and click "create" button. Now 
click on "change" button and type postcard printing operators
inside the function:

<img src="tutorial_l1_6.gif">

Click "Ok" and go back to "Button_002" properties. Just for
a variety you can select the widget icon on widgets tree and
click "Properties" button on toolbar. Click down-arrow button 
next to "-command" entry-box and select "postcard" subroutine
reference.

<img src="tutorial_l1_7.gif">

Now our program is almost complete. You can ever save it and
run instantly. Click on "save" icon and than on "run" icon":

<img src="tutorial_l1_8.gif">

  Great! Our program is working, but how to close all those 
windows? Application window you can close using your window
manager controls (in most cases 'x' button on the top of 
application window). The "output log" window opened in
Unix-like systems that support X-terminals running Unix
utility "less" so you should know how to exit from it (type
"q" inside xterm window).

  Now we've to supply additional service to our user - the way
to finish the application. As we mentioned previously, you 
always can close application window using window manager 
controls ('x' button, keyboard shortcut or window menu), 
but it would be nice to allow "controlled" exit from 
application. For that purpose we created button widget 
"Button_003". Double-click on it (or use right-click
and select "properties"). First of all, let's emphasize 
the button functionality by it's color - select red 
background color (label "-background") and enter message 
"exit" at "-text" field.

<img src="tutorial_l1_9.gif">

In field "-command" enter anonimous procedure "sub {exit}"
that wraps standard Tk "exit" procedure. Generally we can 
write here a reference to any procedure that will be 
executed when our user will press this button.

<img src="tutorial_l1_10.gif">

Finally our application window will look like this:

<img src="tutorial_l1_11.gif">

Don't forget to save it and it's ready to run.

<b> Lesson 3. More complicated case </b>

In this lesson we'll try to create grid-based application.
This mean that each widget will have it's row/column coordinate
on imaginary grid inside main window (mw).

The way we create widget remain very similar to previous lesson:
after running vptk_w.pl we fill application-specific fields in
project properties window.

<img src="tutorial_l2_1.gif">

Then create sub-widget of type "Label":

<img src="tutorial_l2_2.gif">

<img src="tutorial_l2_3.gif">

<img src="tutorial_l2_4.gif">

Open "Label_001" widget's properties. 
Type prompt message "Card 1:" in "-text" field.
Now let's switch to the right part of "properties" window:
select "grid" as widget's geometry and click "Accept" to
commit your changes.

<img src="tutorial_l2_5.gif">

Next element we'll place AFTER label widget, so please make 
sure you select respective option from menu (or use "insert 
after" button on toolbar).

<img src="tutorial_l2_6.gif">

Now select "Entry" type and proceed.

<img src="tutorial_l2_7.gif">

Since we has no opportunity to set new widget's geometry it 
was inherited from 1st one. It was done automatically to 
prevent geometry conflict between neighbor elements. As a 
result the new widget's coordinates became equal to 1st 
widget ones. VPTK_W has it's own mechanism for such conflicts 
re-solving. Now our new widget automatically moved one row down.

<img src="tutorial_l2_8.gif">

We need the entry widget to be on the same row as
label, so let's open newly created widget's properties
and fix it's geometry placement as shown:

<img src="tutorial_l2_9.gif">

Try to create rest of widgets to get the following
design:

<img src="tutorial_l2_10.gif">

Note that rows and columns are numbered from zero. Each
time you see that widget's coordinates differ from
required, simply open widget's properties and change 
"-row" and "-column" values.

Now let's connect widgets to get desired functionality.
Open 1st entry widget properties and set "-textvariable"
value to \$card1 (pointer to variable):

<img src="tutorial_l2_11.gif">

Repeat the same procedure for 2nd entry but with pointer
to other variable \$card2.

And finally apply the same procedure to widget "Label_006":
insert reference to variable $total in field "-textvariable".

As usual let's create routine for button callback. First,
select from main menu "File" -&gt; "Project properties";
select tab "User code after main loop" and create 
subroutine "calc_sum".

<img src="tutorial_l2_12.gif">

The function content should be quite primitive:

<b>sub calc_sum</b>
<b>{</b>
<b>  $total = $card1 + $card2;</b>
<b>}</b>

To finish editing click on "Ok". Now open properties of
"Button_007" (labelled as "Calculate") and select reference
to newly created subroutine in field "-command".

<img src="tutorial_l2_13.gif">

And as usual, after saving the project you can run it
instantly. If everything went well your application should
calculate the sum of two fields in "card1" and "card2"
and display the result behind it.

<img src="tutorial_l2_14.gif">

Finally we can define graceful exit procedure from our
application. Open properties of "Button_008" and enter
anonimous procedure as "-command" field content:

<img src="tutorial_l1_10.gif">
